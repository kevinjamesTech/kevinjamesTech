Getting Started
Click the button below to connect your Spotify account with the Vercel app. This is needed to access your recently played tracks.

By authorizing the app, you agree to have your Spotify username, access token, and refresh token stored on a secure Firebase database. This is required so you only need to authorize once and the app can automatically refresh access tokens in order to retrieve recent tracks.

You can revoke the app at https://www.spotify.com/account/apps.

After granting permission, just add the following into your README and set the user query parameter to your Spotify username.

Trending in Open Source
The Open Source community is currently discussing the benefits of Simpllo, a free and open-source website builder. There's also interest in building SDKs automatically instead of using swagger-ui and msw. The use of Git aliases to boost productivity is being explored, alongside the creation of multilingual Next.js apps. Finally, the community is looking into an open-source ATS tool called Resume Matcher to aid job seekers.
