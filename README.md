Spotify Recently Played README
Display your recently played Spotify tracks on your GitHub profile README. Powered by Vercel.

Check out lastfm-recently-played-readme for a similar integration for Last.fm scrobbles.

Getting Started
Click the button below to connect your Spotify account with the Vercel app. This is needed to access your recently played tracks.

By authorizing the app, you agree to have your Spotify username, access token, and refresh token stored on a secure Firebase database. This is required so you only need to authorize once and the app can automatically refresh access tokens in order to retrieve recent tracks.

You can revoke the app at https://www.spotify.com/account/apps.

Authorize button

After granting permission, just add the following into your README and set the user query parameter to your Spotify username.

Introduction
Try Ÿ HŸPE service as the more robust and feature rich solution.

GHPVС project is proof of concept. This counter designed to be an analytical instrument for you, but not for people who are visiting your profile It could be used to see profile views dynamics as result of development activity, blogging or taking part in a conference.

It counts how many times your GitHub profile has been viewed and displays them in your profile, for free.

Usage
Cloud solution launched as 100% free experience. Help me cut server costs if you like this service.

If you want to see big numbers in your profile, deploy a standalone solution to draw any views count you want without spamming our server. Everybody knows that any counters could be faked.

A billion fake profile views doesn't make you a very popular person, it makes you a person…

How can I add my GitHub profile? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
Create an issue, with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image URL, this will be needed in the next step)

Fork the project, using the top right corner button, that states fork

Create a file named your-username.json in the directory profiles with the following content.

Your entry should be similar to this example:

{
  "image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/91057573-48531300-e61f-11ea-9e13-2d7384e42000.png",

Trending in Open Source
The Open Source community is currently discussing the benefits of Simpllo, a free and open-source website builder. There's also interest in building SDKs automatically instead of using swagger-ui and msw. The use of Git aliases to boost productivity is being explored, alongside the creation of multilingual Next.js apps. Finally, the community is looking into an open-source ATS tool called Resume Matcher to aid job seekers.
